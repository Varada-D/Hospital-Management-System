# About the Project
* The purpose of this project entitled “Hospital Management System” is to develop and provide a user-friendly software which is simple, fast, reliable, and cost-effective. The main function of the system is to store the details of doctors and patients, and retrieve them as and when required, and also to manipulate these details meaningfully.
* This project on Hospital Management System using Java provides distinct functionalities to different types of users (doctors, patients and admin).


## Functionalities
### Doctor
A doctor has the options to:-
1. View the scheduled appointments for her/him and the details of her/his patient.

### Patient
A patient has the options to:-
1. View the facilities provided by the hospital.
2. View the details of available doctors – their qualification, specialization and
contact number.
3. Booking an appointment.
4. Cancelling an appointment.


### Admin
The admin holds the rights to manage (add/remove/modify) the details of doctors and hospital
facilities; and also to allot a room to a patient requiring hospitalization. This portal is, however,
***password-protected***.

# Instructions on Running the File
1. Download the [Source Code](https://github.com/Varada-D/Hospital-Management-System/blob/main/HospitalManagementSystem.java)
2. Ensure that you have [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) installed in your machine
3. Open your Command Prompt, and navigate to the folder containing the source code  
        > Syntax in case the source code is in the same drive as the current: **cd \<path\>**  
        > If you need to change drive to navigate to the required folder: **cd \d \<path\>**
4. After navigating to the required path, compile the java file by typing:  
        > If you haven't changed the file name of the source code: **javac HospitalManagementSystem.java**  
        > Else: **javac \<filename\>.java**  
5. On successful compilation, run the class containing the main function  
        > If you haven't changed the class names: **java Hospital**  
        > Else: **java \<name_of_class_containing_main_function\>**

# Future Enhancements
* The future updates for this project can contain data validation for user inputs. This would ensure that we are getting a valid input from the user.
* The current system, being command-line based, seems to be monotonous and boring to users. Developing the system further, encorporating a GUI (Graphics User Interface) would make the system more attractive, accessible and easy to use.
* As an additional functionality, we can also extend the project by syncing/attaching it to web portals as well. This way, a patient would not have to search elsewhere or call up or go to the hospital to book an appointment. She/he can do it easily within the comfort of her/his home over the internet as well.
